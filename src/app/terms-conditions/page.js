          <p>

          </p>

          <p>To set up your account:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">

            Accessing Services Through the NowStart Solution Client
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Client Overview</h3>
          <p>
            We offer the NowStart Solution client applet ("the client") as a tool to enhance your experience by streamlining access to our advisory services.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>The client performs initial system analysis (e.g., internet speed, security settings, drivers).</li>
            <li>It creates your profile and detects connected hardware to begin and manage system optimizations.</li>
            <li>Full functionality is unlocked only with a valid subscription.</li>
            <li>The client includes a third-party component, cpuidsdk.dll, from CPUID EURL to improve performance recommendations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Installation and Deactivation</h3>
          <p>
            You may deactivate the client at any time using your operating system’s standard procedures:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Windows:</strong> Go to Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Programs, select “NowStart Solution,” and click “Change/Remove.”
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Deactivation may leave behind harmless residual files or registry entries, which can be removed manually. Examples:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Windows XP:</strong>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>You are granted a license to use the client on the number of computers specified in your subscription.</li>
            <li>You may not:
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">

          Using Live Technical Support Assistance to Access Services
        </h1>

        <section className="space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          <p>
            You can contact our live technical support agents by phone if you have an active, paid subscription to the services. These agents can often provide remote diagnostics, where, with your consent, the technician accesses your devices remotely through a proxy connection.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may either call a technician directly or schedule a support call in advance. The technician will request the email address associated with your account. To be eligible for support, you must ensure:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Our agents have full access to the devices, local area network, or system experiencing the issue.</li>
            <li>You have a valid, active subscription in good standing for the affected devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You must also have your own internet connection. All supported hardware (as defined below) must be connected to a high-speed internet connection for the services to function properly. Dial-up and satellite internet connections are not supported and do not meet the minimum requirements for remote access through NowStart Solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            NowStart Solution aims to make support services available 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding recognized legal holidays. However, service availability may be temporarily interrupted at times. For support requests that fall outside the scope of services defined in these Terms of Service, NowStart Solution may offer additional support via phone agents for an extra fee.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our agents support both desktops and notebooks running Microsoft® Windows operating systems, collectively referred to as "supported PCs." The following software and applications are supported in publicly available versions:

          <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-4">
          Subscriptions, Billing, and Cancellation
        </h1>

        <section className="space-y-5 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Ongoing Subscriptions:</h2>
          <p>
            Your NowStart Solution subscription will automatically renew either monthly or annually—depending on your initial purchase—unless you cancel it or we terminate it. If your subscription started with a reduced introductory price, you will be charged the full subscription rate once the introductory period ends, as disclosed at the time of purchase. To use the Services, you must have internet access and provide a valid, accepted, and current payment method (referred to as "Payment Method"), which you may update at any time. We will charge your selected subscription fee to your Payment Method based on the term you chose. To avoid being charged for the next subscription term, you must cancel before the auto-renewal date, according to the term you initially selected.
          </p>

          <p>
            Be aware that applicable taxes may be included in your subscription charge depending on local laws. In some regions, sales tax may apply; if not collected, you may still be responsible for submitting use tax or other similar taxes. If it is later determined that sales tax should have been collected for your region, we will apply that charge to your account.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Different Subscription Plans:</h2>
          <p>
            We may offer various subscription plans, including promotional offers or plans with unique terms and conditions. Any significant differences from the terms outlined in these Terms of Service will be clearly disclosed to you during sign-up, in your order, or through our communications. You can access specific details about your NowStart Solution subscription by visiting our website and clicking on the “Your Account” link. We reserve the right to modify, discontinue, or otherwise change the subscription plans at our sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Recurring Billing:</h2>
          <p>
            By starting your NowStart Solution subscription and providing a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method at the then-current rate—monthly or annually depending on your selected term—and to include any other charges related to your use of NowStart Solution. You agree that the amount charged may vary from term to term due to factors such as promotional offers, redeemed gift cards or promo codes, or plan upgrades. You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for any such changes, which may be billed as one or multiple charges per billing cycle.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Price Changes:</h2>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to change the pricing of our services, or any parts thereof, at any time and at our sole discretion. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, you will be notified of any price changes by email before they take effect.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Billing Cycle:</h2>
          <p>
            Subscription fees will be charged at the beginning of each paid subscription period and will automatically continue on each billing cycle until cancellation. Your Payment Method will be billed on the same calendar day that your subscription originally began. Subscription fees are deemed earned once paid. We may modify your billing schedule if there are issues processing your payment. If your subscription starts on a date that does not occur in a future month (e.g., January 31), we may charge your Payment Method on the closest applicable date (e.g., February 28). Any changes to your subscription may alter your renewal date. To find your next renewal date, go to the “Your Account” page and click “View billing details.” We may pre-authorize your Payment Method for upcoming charges. In these Terms, “billing” refers to all processes of charging, debiting, or collecting payments from your Payment Method. The terms “monthly,” “annually,” or “term” refer to your billing cycle unless otherwise indicated.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">No Refunds:</h2>
          <p>
            All payments are non-refundable. We do not issue refunds or credits for partial subscription periods. After cancellation, you will retain access to the service until the end of your current billing period. In some cases, we may choose—at our sole discretion—to issue refunds, credits, or discounts. The amount, type, and issuance of such credits are entirely up to us and do not establish any obligation to provide similar compensation in the future.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Cancellation:</h2>
          <p>
            You may cancel your NowStart Solution subscription at any time. Access to the service will continue until the end of your current billing cycle. WE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIAL PERIODS. To cancel, go to the “Your Account” page on our website and follow the cancellation steps. Your account will automatically close at the end of your billing period. For specific closure dates, click “View billing details” in your account settings.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Subscriber Eligibility and Use of Services</h2>
          <p>
            To be eligible for a subscription, you must be at least 18 years old or have reached the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction.

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Passwords and Account Access</h2>
          <p>
            The person who creates the NowStart Solution account and provides the Payment Method is considered the Account Owner, who maintains control over the account through their password. To maintain exclusive control, you should not share your password or Payment Method details (e.g., card’s last four digits or PayPal email) with others.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Please read this carefully. It’s important to understand how it affects your rights.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        At NowStart Solution, we strive to ensure that our outstanding service team can resolve most issues you may experience while using our services. You can visit our help center for answers to common questions or contact our customer service team for assistance. In the rare event that a problem remains unresolved, we believe in setting clear expectations from the outset to avoid confusion later. Therefore, both you and NowStart Solution agree to the resolution process described below.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You and NowStart Solution agree to first attempt to resolve any issue informally for a minimum of 30 days to reach the quickest and most efficient resolution possible. To initiate this, please send an email to NowStart Solution at:
        NowStart Solution, 14 West Second Street, Suite 108, Upland, CA 91786 — Attn: Legal Department.
        Be sure to include your full name, contact information, and your proposed resolution. If we need to contact you, we will reach out using the email address associated with your NowStart Solution account.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If after at least 30 days of informal communication we are unable to come to an agreement, you and NowStart Solution agree to resolve any claim (arising from or related to these terms—including their formation, performance, or breach—our relationship, or your use of the services) through binding arbitration. This arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, which you can access here
        .
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, NowStart Solution permits you to bring a claim in small claims court as long as you proceed on an individual basis. This is an exception to the arbitration agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        To ensure a timely resolution, both parties agree that any arbitration must begin within one year from when the claim arises. Any claim not brought within that timeframe will be considered waived. Furthermore, both parties agree to arbitrate only on an individual basis and not to participate in any class actions. Each of us explicitly waives any right to file or participate in a class action or seek relief on a class-wide basis.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">All arbitration hearings will take place in Upland, California.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You can download or print a form notice and arbitration initiation form at www.adr.org
        . If you initiate arbitration, your fees will be limited to the filing fee outlined in the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. NowStart Solution will cover all other arbitration-related fees, including your portion of the arbitrator’s compensation, regardless of who initiates the process.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please note: the arbitrator's decision is final and can be enforced in any court with appropriate jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you're uncertain about any of these terms, we recommend consulting an attorney.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We understand that discussing potential problems may not be ideal, but we are committed to transparency. We appreciate your understanding of the importance of this process and your agreement with the terms outlined here.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Survival Clause:</h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If any portion of these terms of service is found to be void, unlawful, or unenforceable, the remaining terms will remain valid, lawful, and enforceable.

        If you prefer not to receive interest-based ads outside of NowStart Solution apps, adjust your mobile device settings to limit ad tracking.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Note that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see NowStart Solution advertisements elsewhere—but they won’t be personalized based on your interactions with NowStart Solution.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We also run ad campaigns on social networks and other third-party platforms. These ads may be personalized based on user insights, such as identifying customers who may benefit from an NowStart Solution upgrade.

          <p>
            If a user or customer believes that removed content is not infringing or that they have
            legal authorization (e.g., from the copyright owner), they may submit a DMCA
            counter-notice, including the following:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li>
              Identification of the material that was removed or access to which was disabled, and
              the location where it appeared before removal
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the user or authorized representative
              believes in good faith that the removal was due to a mistake or misidentification
            </li>
            <li>
              A statement of consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in the user’s judicial
              district (or any district where the allegedly infringing material is located if
              outside the U.S.), and agreement to accept service of process from the original
              complainant
            </li>
            <li>A physical or digital signature of the user or authorized representative</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note: Filing a false counter-notice may result in legal liability. Legal advice is
            strongly recommended. If a valid counter-notice is received, we may forward it to the
            original complainant. Unless the copyright owner initiates legal proceedings, we may
            reinstate the content or restore access at our discretion.

          <p>
            Some ads you see on websites are customized based on your browsing behavior across
            various websites and devices. This type of advertising, known as “interest-based” or
            “online behavioral” advertising, helps support the online content, products, and
            services you use.
